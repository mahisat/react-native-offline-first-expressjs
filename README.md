# react-native-offline-first-expressjs
Example of offline-first app with React Native and express js as Backend

You can create, update, and delete when not internet connection is available and then sync it to server

Credit goes to this https://github.com/philipshurpik/react-native-offline-first repository and it is created with react-native 0.28.0. I updated it with 0.63.2 and make it workable version.
